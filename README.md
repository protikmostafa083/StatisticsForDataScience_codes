### 1.  Central Tendency
For missing value imputation or to understand the data it is often required to find out the central tendency of the data. There are several ways to find out the central tendency. Those are namely, 
* Mean
* Median
* Mode

### 2.  Data Spread
To find out the spread of data, we have to rely on the variance or the standard deviation. Variance has some limitation in the calculation process as it uses the square term. Standard deviation rules out the problem because it is the square root of the variance. In this part of the code, i have done a practice on
* Variance
* Standard Deviation
* Range
* Percentile
* IQR(Inter Quartile Range)

### 2.  Hypothesis Test - Part 1
In this part, I have practiced the hypothesis testing using P value and T test/Z value. Hypotheis testing is necessary to find out the credibility of an assumption. It helps to figure out if the made assumption is accepted based on the confidence level or it need to be revised.
